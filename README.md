# SocketMongoChat Server (Websocket Chat Server)

This is experimental project for showcasing the power of Websockets in realtime communication with server.
This is only a server part of whole application . To learn the client interface of
this chat application pls refer [https://github.com/codediggeracademy/SocketMongoChatClient.git]

This project uses below technologies

* MongoDB (via mLAB - Cloud based Mongo DB on heroku)
* WebSockets (via Socket.io)
* NodeJS 
* Docker (using Docker Compose)

## About Socket.io

Socket.IO enables real-time bidirectional event-based communication.
It works on every platform, browser or device, focusing equally on reliability and speed.

### Real-time analytics :
Push data to clients that gets represented as real-time counters, charts or logs.

### Instant messaging and chat :
Socket.IO's "Hello world" is a chat app in just a few lines of code.

### Binary streaming : 
Starting in 1.0, it's possible to send any blob back and forth: image, audio, video.

### Document collaboration :
Allow users to concurrently edit a document and see each other's changes.

cd <cloned directory name>
npm install
docker-compose up 
```

Pls check console to see your server must have started at 4000 port and print below
things in console

```
